- [ ] Update config/constants to add `CONF_LIBRARY_USER_ID` (or similar) and migrate legacy entries by defaulting it to `None`.
- [ ] Refactor `config_flow.py` so `async_step_user` only captures connection info, caches the authenticated client, and transitions to a new feature step.
- [ ] Implement the new feature step that shows Upcoming/YAMC toggles plus a Jellyfin user dropdown (populated via the cached client) and persists the selected user id when required.
- [ ] Mirror the same multi-step behavior in `JellyfinOptionsFlowHandler`, including validation when toggles are enabled but no user id is selected.
- [ ] Thread the stored user id through `JellyfinClientManager` and the sensor helpers, replacing `{UserId}` placeholders and adding guards/logging for missing ids.
- [ ] Add regression coverage (unit test or config-flow test harness) that exercises enabling Upcoming/YAMC, selecting a user, and verifying the stored config entry data.
